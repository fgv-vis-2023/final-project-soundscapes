To decide what topic would be approached and therefore get such project starting, the group decided together what subject would be of not only the members' interest, but would appeal for the users as well, and nothing sounded more universal than music. Looking through options, the dataset that showed some of the top tracks on Spotify over the last two decades were chosen, since it would be a great way to build a good, interest and interactive storytelling for the consumer.

Initial goals were simple, creating and pleasant looking page that the user could learn more about the bigger picture of the music scene on the last two decades (according to Spotify's biggest tracks). Further discussions landed on providing a way the consmumers could have an historical view for these last decades (for the different metrics available), analyze how the genres have been doing and even being able to search musics of theis interest and seeing how they were rankes through the metrics, adding the interactiveness and personalization needed for a good project. 

With the visualizations ideas designed, the project needed and identity. Always with the objective of constructing an interactive storytelling, the connection between waves (sound waves) and music inspired an idea of making the project resemble a dive in the ocean, starting with a shallow part, a superficial one, and adding depth as you swim out to sea, so, starting with a more generic visualization, adding complexity and interactiveness as you scroll down the page. With that, the deep dive on Spotify's tracks concept was born.
