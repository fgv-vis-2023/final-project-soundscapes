## Project's Decisions

To decide what topic would be approached and therefore get such project starting, the group decided together what subject would be of not only the members' interest, but would appeal for the users as well, and nothing sounded more universal than music. Looking through options, the dataset that showed some of the top tracks on Spotify over the last two decades were chosen, since it would be a great way to build a good, interest and interactive storytelling for the consumer.

Initial goals were simple, creating a pleasant looking page that the user could learn more about the bigger picture of the music scene on the last two decades (according to Spotify's biggest tracks). Further discussions landed on providing a way the consmumers could have an historical view for these last decades (for the different metrics available), analyze how the genres have been doing and even being able to search musics of theis interest and seeing how they were rankes through the metrics, adding the interactiveness and personalization needed for a good project. 

With the visualizations ideas designed, the project needed and identity. Always with the objective of constructing an interactive storytelling, the connection between waves (sound waves) and music inspired an idea of making the project resemble a dive in the ocean, starting with a shallow part, a superficial one, and adding depth as you swim out to sea, so, starting with a more generic visualization, adding complexity and interactiveness as you scroll down the page. With that, the deep dive on Spotify's tracks concept was born.

Then the group decided it would be a good distribution if each of the members focused on one visualization, so the work would be more balanced and the members could focus on their own visualization, making it the best they could. Obviously that didn't mean that the members wouldn't help each other, fixing bugs for each other and giving tips on what could be improved to the better of the project. With that, the group decided that the first visualization would be a general overview of the top tracks, with the second one being a more historical view of the top tracks, and the third one being a more personal view, where the user could search for a specific track and see how it ranked on the different metrics. That lead to the three visualizations presented in the page, the first one being more superficial and adding depth through out the page, as the user scrolls down. 

As our colleagues appointed critics to the project, such as lack of information to the scatterplot's axis, placement of metrics explanation, upgrading such bar on the third visualization, we took them into consideration and made the necessary changes to the project, making it more informative and clearer. Obviously all the critics were made in the intetion to help the project grow, but onde main decisions when analyzing critics is selecting those which are in sync with the group's view of the project, maintaining the concepts and the identity of it. One key aspects of the peer critique was also bug fixes, since them as costumers canhelp identify which features are not working well when exploring the page, helping the group correct them to the final presentation.
